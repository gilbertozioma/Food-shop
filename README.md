# Food-shop
I developed a comprehensive food ordering website that encompasses both frontend and backend functionalities. Users can easily register, log in, browse, and order various food items. The frontend was built using Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend utilizes PHP and MySQL. If you're interested in contributing, please send me a direct message on Twitter using the handle provided in my bio, and I'll share the database details with you.
